# OOPS Question

## What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?

In Java, a class and an object are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). They serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

1.  Class:
    
    -   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
    -   It defines the structure and behavior of objects. This includes the attributes (data members or fields) and methods (functions) that objects of the class will have.
    -   A class is a user-defined data type that represents a real-world entity or concept.
    -   It is a static concept, meaning it doesn't exist in memory during the program's execution, only its objects do.
    -   Classes are defined using the `class` keyword in Java.
    
    Example:
  
        class Car {
	        String make;
	        String model;
	        int year;
		    void startEngine() {
		        // Implementation of the startEngine method
		    }    
        }
   
2.  Object:
    
    -   An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete, tangible representation of the class's blueprint.
    -   Objects are created from classes and have their own set of attributes and can execute methods defined in the class.
    -   Objects are dynamic entities that exist in memory during the program's execution.
    -   Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class name.
    
Example:
  
      
	Car myCar = new Car();
    myCar.make = "Toyota";
    myCar.model = "Camry";
    myCar.year = 2023;
    myCar.startEngine();

In the example above, `Car` is a class that serves as a blueprint for creating car objects. `myCar` is an object created from the `Car` class. It has its own set of attributes (make, model, year) and can execute methods (startEngine) defined in the class.

In summary, a class defines the structure and behavior of objects, while an object is an instance of a class that represents a specific, individual entity based on that blueprint.

## Explain the concept of inheritance in Java. How is it implemented, and why is it important in OOP?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), and it plays a crucial role in Java. Inheritance allows one class (the subclass or child class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (the superclass or parent class). This promotes code reusability and helps to model the "is-a" relationship between classes. Here's an explanation of how inheritance works in Java:

**Implementation of Inheritance in Java:**

In Java, you can implement inheritance using the `extends` keyword. The child class inherits the fields (attributes) and methods from the parent class. Here's a basic example:

    class Vehicle {
        String brand;
        int year;
    
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Starting the vehicle");
        }
    }
    
    class Car extends Vehicle {
        int numberOfDoors;
    
        void accelerate() {
            System.out.println("Car is accelerating");
        }
    }



In this example, `Vehicle` is the parent class, and `Car` is the child class. The `Car` class inherits the `brand` and `year` fields as well as the `start()` method from the `Vehicle` class. Additionally, the `Car` class has its own unique field `numberOfDoors` and a method `accelerate()`.

**Why Inheritance is Important in OOP:**

1.  **Code Reusability:** Inheritance allows you to reuse the fields and methods of an existing class. Instead of rewriting common code in multiple classes, you can create a base class with shared functionality and extend it to create specialized subclasses. This reduces code duplication and makes your code easier to maintain.
    
2.  **Hierarchical Organization:** Inheritance enables you to create a hierarchy of classes. You can model real-world relationships effectively, such as "Car is a Vehicle," "Dog is an Animal," etc. This makes the code more intuitive and reflective of the problem domain.
    
3.  **Polymorphism:** Inheritance is closely tied to the concept of polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. This promotes flexibility and allows you to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction.
    
4.  **Ease of Maintenance:** Changes made to the parent class can affect all its subclasses, reducing the need for modifications in multiple places. This is especially valuable when adding new functionality or fixing bugs.
    

In summary, inheritance in Java allows you to create a class hierarchy where child classes inherit the attributes and methods of parent classes. It's a fundamental OOP concept that promotes code reusability, effective modeling of real-world relationships, and improved code organization and maintenance.

In Java, there are several types of inheritance, which dictate how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. The main types of inheritance in Java are:

1.  **Single Inheritance:**
    
    -   Single inheritance means that a class can inherit from only one superclass. In other words, a class can have only one immediate parent class.
    -   Java supports single inheritance for classes, which means that each class can have a single superclass from which it inherits.
    
    Example:
     
        class Animal {
            // ...
        }
        class Dog extends Animal {
            // ...
        }
    
2.  **Multiple Inheritance (Interface Inheritance):**
    
    -   Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one class or interface. However, Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes to avoid the "diamond problem" (a problem that arises when a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor).
    -   In Java, multiple inheritance is achieved through interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, thus inheriting multiple sets of method signatures.
    
    
    Example:
        
        interface Swimmer {
            void swim();
        }
        
        interface Flyer {
            void fly();
        }
        
        class Bird implements Swimmer, Flyer {
            // ...
        }
    
3.  **Multilevel Inheritance:**
    
    -   Multilevel inheritance involves a chain of inheritance in which a class is derived from another class, which in turn is derived from yet another class. It creates a hierarchy of classes.

>     class A {
>         // ...
>     }
>     
>     class B extends A {
>         // ...
>     }
>     
>     class C extends B {
>         // ...
>     }

    
4.  **Hierarchical Inheritance:**
    
    -   Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple classes inheriting from a single base class. This means that several derived classes can share common characteristics with one parent class.
    
 Example 
 
    class Vehicle {
        // ...
    }
    
    class Car extends Vehicle {
        // ...
    }
    
    class Bike extends Vehicle {
        // ...
    }

        

5.  **Hybrid Inheritance (Not Supported):**
    
    -   Hybrid inheritance combines multiple forms of inheritance in one program. In Java, pure hybrid inheritance is not supported because it can lead to complexity and ambiguity. For example, combining multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance can lead to issues like the diamond problem.

Java supports single inheritance for classes, but it allows for multiple inheritance through interfaces. The combination of these inheritance types and the use of interfaces allows developers to achieve flexible and efficient code organization and reuse while avoiding some of the pitfalls associated with multiple inheritance in other languages.

## Diamond problem

The "diamond problem" is a term used in object-oriented programming to describe an ambiguity that can arise when a particular kind of multiple inheritance is used. This problem is not unique to Java; it can occur in any programming language that supports multiple inheritance, including languages like C++.

The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common ancestor. This creates an ambiguity when a method or attribute is called that is defined in the common ancestor. The problem arises because the language needs to determine which version of the method or attribute to use. Here's an example to illustrate the diamond problem:


    class A {
        void foo() {
            System.out.println("A's foo");
        }
    }
    
    class B extends A {
        void foo() {
            System.out.println("B's foo");
        }
    }
    
    class C extends A {
        void foo() {
            System.out.println("C's foo");
        }
    }
    
    class D extends B, C {
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            D d = new D();
            d.foo(); // Which "foo" should be called? From B or C?
        }
    }


In this example, class `D` inherits from both class `B` and class `C`, which, in turn, inherit from class `A`. When you create an instance of `D` and call the `foo` method, there is an ambiguity because both `B` and `C` have overridden the `foo` method from class `A. The language doesn't know which version of the` foo` method to call, resulting in the diamond problem.

In languages like Java, this problem is avoided by not allowing multiple inheritance of classes. However, Java allows multiple inheritance of interfaces, which doesn't lead to the diamond problem since interfaces only define method signatures, and a class implementing multiple interfaces must provide implementations for all the methods, resolving any ambiguity at the class level.

In Java, interfaces can help resolve the diamond problem by allowing multiple inheritance of method signatures without causing ambiguity. Here's an example illustrating how interfaces can be used to solve the diamond problem:

Suppose you have the following classes and interfaces:

    interface A {
        void foo();
    }
    
    class B implements A {
        public void foo() {
            System.out.println("B's foo");
        }
    }
    
    class C implements A {
        public void foo() {
            System.out.println("C's foo");
        }
    }
    
    class D implements B, C {
        // D can implement both B and C because they don't have conflicting method signatures.
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            D d = new D();
            d.foo(); // Calls either B's foo or C's foo, depending on the reference used to create d.
        }
    }

In this example, we have two interfaces `A` and two classes `B` and `C` that implement interface `A`. Class `D` implements both `B` and `C`, but because the interfaces don't have conflicting method signatures, there's no ambiguity. When you create an instance of `D` and call the `foo` method, it can call either `B`'s `foo` or `C`'s `foo`, depending on the reference used to create `d`.

This demonstrates how interfaces allow for multiple inheritance of method signatures without causing the diamond problem because each class implementing the interface must provide its own implementation of the methods.

Certainly! Here's another example illustrating how interfaces in Java resolve the diamond problem without ambiguity:

Suppose you have the following classes and interfaces:

    interface Shape {
        double area();
    }
    
    class Circle implements Shape {
        private double radius;
    
        public Circle(double radius) {
            this.radius = radius;
        }
    
        public double area() {
            return Math.PI * radius * radius;
        }
    }
    
    class Rectangle implements Shape {
        private double length;
        private double width;
    
        public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
            this.length = length;
            this.width = width;
        }
    
        public double area() {
            return length * width;
        }
    }
    
    class CircleAndRectangle implements Shape {
        private Circle circle;
        private Rectangle rectangle;
    
        public CircleAndRectangle(double radius, double length, double width) {
            this.circle = new Circle(radius);
            this.rectangle = new Rectangle(length, width);
        }
    
        public double area() {
            // You can choose to calculate the area based on the circle or rectangle.
            // No ambiguity because they implement the same interface.
            return circle.area(); // or rectangle.area();
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            CircleAndRectangle shape = new CircleAndRectangle(3.0, 4.0, 5.0);
            System.out.println("Area: " + shape.area()); // Calls either circle's area or rectangle's area.
        }
    }

In this example, we have an interface `Shape`, which defines a method `area()`. Two classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, implement this interface. Then, we have a class `CircleAndRectangle` that encapsulates instances of both `Circle` and `Rectangle` and implements the `Shape` interface.

When you create an instance of `CircleAndRectangle` and call the `area` method, there is no ambiguity because both `Circle` and `Rectangle` implement the same interface `Shape`. The `CircleAndRectangle` class can choose to calculate the area based on either the circle or the rectangle, demonstrating how interfaces in Java allow for multiple inheritance without causing the diamond problem.

## **Encapsulation**

**Encapsulation** is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), and it plays a vital role in Java. It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and the concept of information hiding, which are crucial aspects of OOP. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java and how it facilitates data hiding:

1.  **Attributes (Data Members):** In Java, a class can have attributes, also known as data members or fields. These attributes represent the state or characteristics of objects created from that class.
    
2.  **Methods:** A class can have methods (functions) that define the behavior of the class. These methods can operate on the class's attributes and perform various operations.
    
3.  **Access Modifiers:** Encapsulation in Java is achieved by using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. These modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of attributes and methods:
    
    -   `private`: Attributes and methods marked as private are only accessible within the same class. They are hidden from external classes.
        
    -   `protected`: Attributes and methods marked as protected are accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
        
    -   `public`: Attributes and methods marked as public are accessible from anywhere in the program.
        
    -   Default (no modifier): If an attribute or method has no access modifier specified, it is accessible within the same package but not outside of it.
        

By using these access modifiers and controlling the visibility of attributes and methods, encapsulation helps achieve **data hiding**. Data hiding is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world, allowing an object to control how its data is accessed and modified.

**Benefits of Encapsulation and Data Hiding in Java:**

1.  **Modularity:** Encapsulation allows you to create modular and well-organized code by bundling related attributes and methods together within a class.
    
2.  **Security:** By hiding the internal details of a class, you can protect data from unauthorized access and manipulation. This helps prevent unintended errors or security vulnerabilities.
    
3.  **Flexibility:** You can change the internal implementation of a class (attributes and methods) without affecting the code that uses the class. This provides flexibility in maintaining and evolving your software.
    
4.  **Maintainability:** Encapsulation promotes code maintainability by localizing changes to the class where they belong, reducing the impact of changes on other parts of the program.
    

In summary, encapsulation in Java involves bundling data and methods within a class and using access modifiers to control the visibility of these members. It helps achieve data hiding, which enhances the security, modularity, and maintainability of your code.


Certainly, let's illustrate these access modifiers with examples in Java:

1.  **`private` Access Modifier:**
    
    -   A `private` attribute or method is only accessible within the same class. It is not visible or accessible to external classes.
    
    
 

       class MyClass {
            private int privateAttribute;
        
            private void privateMethod() {
                System.out.println("This is a private method.");
            }
        
            public void accessPrivate() {
                System.out.println(privateAttribute);
                privateMethod();
            }
        }
        
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
                // The following lines would cause compilation errors because privateAttribute and privateMethod are private.
                // myObject.privateAttribute = 10;
                // myObject.privateMethod();
                myObject.accessPrivate(); // This works because accessPrivate is a public method in the same class.
            }
        }
    
2.  **`protected` Access Modifier:**
    
    -   A `protected` attribute or method is accessible within the same package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages.
    
      package mypackage;
        
        public class Parent {
            protected int protectedAttribute;
        
            protected void protectedMethod() {
                System.out.println("This is a protected method.");
            }
        }
        
        class Child extends Parent {
            public void accessProtected() {
                System.out.println(protectedAttribute); // Accessing protectedAttribute from the subclass.
                protectedMethod(); // Accessing protectedMethod from the subclass.
            }
        }
        
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Child childObject = new Child();
                childObject.accessProtected(); // This works because Child is a subclass and within the same package.
            }
        } 
    
3.  **`public` Access Modifier:**
    
    -   A `public` attribute or method is accessible from anywhere in the program, regardless of the package.
  

>     public class PublicExample {
>         public int publicAttribute;
>     
>         public void publicMethod() {
>             System.out.println("This is a public method.");
>         }
>     }
>     
>     public class Main {
>         public static void main(String[] args) {
>             PublicExample publicObject = new PublicExample();
>             System.out.println(publicObject.publicAttribute); // Accessing the public attribute.
>             publicObject.publicMethod(); // Accessing the public method.
>         }
>     }

    
4.  **Default (No Modifier) Access Modifier:**
    
    -   If an attribute or method has no access modifier specified, it is accessible within the same package but not outside of it.
   
    

> package mypackage;
> 
> public class DefaultExample {
>     int defaultAttribute; // No access modifier specified.
> 
>     void defaultMethod() { // No access modifier specified.
>         System.out.println("This is a default method.");
>     } }

    

In the case of the default access modifier, classes in the same package can access these attributes and methods, but classes in other packages cannot.

## **Describe the four main principles of OOP and how they are applied in Java.**

Certainly! Here are the four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how they are applied in Java with examples:

**1. Encapsulation:**

-   **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts access to some of an object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data.
    
-   **Application in Java:**
    
    -   In Java, you use access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public` to control the visibility and accessibility of attributes and methods within a class.
    -   Getters and setters are commonly used to provide controlled access to attributes.

**Example:**

    public class Person {
        private String name; // Private attribute
    
        public String getName() { // Public getter method
            return name;
        }
    
        public void setName(String name) { // Public setter method
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

**2. Inheritance:**

-   **Definition:** Inheritance allows a class (subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or parent class). It promotes code reusability and models the "is-a" relationship.
    
-   **Application in Java:**
    
    -   In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.

**Example:**

    class Animal {
        void eat() {
            System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
        }
    }
    
    class Dog extends Animal {
        void bark() {
            System.out.println("Dog is barking.");
        }
    }


**3. Polymorphism:**

-   **Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It simplifies complex operations by allowing the same method to have different implementations in different classes.
    
-   **Application in Java:**
    
    -   Polymorphism in Java is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
    -   Java supports runtime polymorphism through the use of interfaces and method overriding.

**Example:**

    interface Shape {
        void draw();
    }
    
    class Circle implements Shape {
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
        }
    }
    
    class Square implements Shape {
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a square.");
        }
    }

**4. Abstraction:**

-   **Definition:** Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on real-world objects. It hides the complex, unnecessary details of an object and exposes only the relevant parts.
    
-   **Application in Java:**
    
    -   Abstraction in Java can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

**Example:**

    abstract class Shape {
        abstract void draw(); // Abstract method, no implementation.
    }
    
    class Circle extends Shape {
        void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
        }
    }

These are the four main principles of OOP and how they are applied in Java. They help in creating well-structured, maintainable, and reusable code.

If you'd like more details on a specific topic or have further questions, feel free to ask.

## **Should abstract method have implementation.**

In Java, an abstract method is a method declared in an abstract class or interface but doesn't have an implementation in that class or interface. It's defined using the `abstract` keyword and doesn't include a method body (curly braces and code). Abstract methods serve as placeholders for methods that must be implemented by concrete (non-abstract) subclasses or classes that implement the interface.

For example, here's how you declare an abstract method in an abstract class and a concrete class that extends it:

    abstract class Animal {
        // This is an abstract method with no implementation.
        abstract void makeSound();
    }
    
    class Dog extends Animal {
        // Concrete subclasses must provide an implementation for abstract methods.
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Woof!");
        }
    }

The abstract class `Animal` defines an abstract method `makeSound()`, which is later implemented in the concrete subclass `Dog`. Abstract methods are meant to be overridden and given a specific implementation in subclasses or classes that implement the interface. They serve as a contract, ensuring that specific methods are available in derived classes.

## ****Polymorphism in Java****

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Java and object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This simplifies complex operations by allowing the same method or operation to have different implementations in different classes. There are two types of polymorphism in Java:

1.  **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):** Also known as static polymorphism, this occurs when multiple methods have the same name within a class, but they have different parameter lists (number or type of parameters). The appropriate method to call is determined at compile time based on the method signature.
    
    **Example - Method Overloading:**
    

> class Calculator {
>     int add(int a, int b) {
>         return a + b;
>     }
> 
>     double add(double a, double b) {
>         return a + b;
>     } }

    
2.  **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):** Also known as dynamic polymorphism, this occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method to call is determined at runtime based on the object's actual class.
    
    **Example - Method Overriding:**
   
    

> class Shape {
>     void draw() {
>         System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
>     } }
> 
> class Circle extends Shape {
>     @Override
>     void draw() {
>         System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
>     } }

    

**Advantages of Polymorphism in OOP:**

1.  **Code Reusability:** Polymorphism allows you to reuse code by defining common interfaces or superclasses, enabling objects of different classes to be used interchangeably.
    
2.  **Flexibility:** It provides flexibility to create new classes that can work with existing classes without modifying their source code.
    
3.  **Ease of Maintenance:** Changes to the behavior of a class can be localized to that class, reducing the risk of introducing bugs in other parts of the program.
    
4.  **Improved Extensibility:** Polymorphism facilitates adding new classes or methods to a program without affecting existing code.
    
5.  **Enhanced Readability:** Code that uses polymorphism is more readable and comprehensible because it's based on general abstractions and common interfaces.
    

Polymorphism is a powerful and fundamental concept in OOP that promotes flexibility, code reusability, and maintainability.

## ******The "super" Keyword in Java:******

The "super" keyword in Java is used to refer to the superclass, specifically when working with inheritance. It has two primary purposes:

1.  **Accessing Superclass Members:** You can use "super" to access members (fields or methods) of the superclass from within a subclass. This is helpful when a subclass wants to use or override the superclass's members.
    
2.  **Invoking Superclass Constructors:** You can use "super" to call the constructor of the superclass. This is essential when the subclass constructor needs to initialize the inherited attributes or invoke specific behavior from the superclass constructor.
    

**Usage Example of "super" in Inheritance:**

    class Animal {
        String name;
    
        Animal(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
        }
    }
    
    class Dog extends Animal {
        String breed;
    
        Dog(String name, String breed) {
            super(name); // Calling the superclass constructor.
            this.breed = breed;
        }
    
        @Override
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
            super.makeSound(); // Calling the superclass method.
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
            System.out.println("Name: " + myDog.name);
            System.out.println("Breed: " + myDog.breed);
            myDog.makeSound();
        }
    }



In this example, the "super" keyword is used to call the superclass constructor in the `Dog` class, which initializes the `name` attribute. It is also used to invoke the `makeSound` method from the superclass within the overridden `makeSound` method in the `Dog` class.

**Abstract Class in Java:**

An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and may have some methods with no implementation (abstract methods) that must be overridden by concrete subclasses. Abstract classes can also have regular (non-abstract) methods with implementations.

## ***Key Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces:***

1.  **Abstract Classes:**
    -   Can have abstract methods (methods without implementations) and regular methods.
    -   Can have attributes (fields).
    -   Can have constructors.
    -   Allow for single inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).
2.  **Interfaces:**
    -   Can only have abstract methods (by default, all methods are abstract).
    -   Cannot have attributes (fields) but can have constants (public static final variables).
    -   Cannot have constructors.
    -   Allow multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).

**Example of an Abstract Class:**

    abstract class Shape {
        int x, y;
    
        Shape(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    
        abstract double calculateArea();
    }
    
    class Circle extends Shape {
        double radius;
    
        Circle(int x, int y, double radius) {
            super(x, y);
            this.radius = radius;
        }
    
        @Override
        double calculateArea() {
            return Math.PI * radius * radius;
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Circle circle = new Circle(2, 3, 4.0);
            System.out.println("Circle Area: " + circle.calculateArea());
        }
    }

In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class with an abstract method `calculateArea()`. The `Circle` class extends `Shape`, providing an implementation for the abstract method. The abstract class `Shape` also has an attribute and a constructor.

## ***Constructors in Java:***
A constructor in Java is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type, not even `void`. Constructors are often used to set the initial state of an object, allocate resources, and perform other setup tasks.

**Types of Constructors in Java:**

1.  **Default Constructor:** If a class does not have any constructors defined, Java provides a default constructor with no arguments. It initializes the object with default values or performs basic setup.
  
   

>      class MyClass {
>             // Default constructor is provided by Java if no constructor is defined.
>         }

    
2.  **Parameterized Constructor:** These constructors accept one or more parameters and are used to initialize an object with specific values.

>   class Student {
>     String name;
>     int age;
> 
>     Student(String name, int age) {
>         this.name = name;
>         this.age = age;
>     } }

    
3.  **Copy Constructor:** A copy constructor is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object of the same class. It is not provided by Java but can be defined by the programmer.
   

> class Person {
>     String name;
> 
>     Person(String name) {
>         this.name = name;
>     }
> 
>     Person(Person otherPerson) {
>         this.name = otherPerson.name;
>     } }

## ***Composition in Java:***

Composition is a design principle in Java where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes, rather than inheriting from those classes. It allows you to create complex objects by combining simpler objects. Composition promotes code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability.

**Example of Composition:**

    class Engine {
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Engine started");
        }
    }
    
    class Car {
        private Engine engine;
    
        Car() {
            engine = new Engine();
        }
    
        void startCar() {
            System.out.println("Starting the car...");
            engine.start();
            System.out.println("Car started");
        }
    }

In this example, the `Car` class is composed of an `Engine` object. The `Car` class uses the `Engine` object to perform the `startCar` operation, demonstrating composition. This approach allows for a more flexible and maintainable design, as you can change or upgrade the engine without affecting the `Car` class.
